Laravel tests cover participant-only registration, inactive account rejection, CMS permissions, instructor ownership, enrolment-gated progress, duplicate-safe completion, mentorship exclusivity, income ownership and sync replay, event capacity, certificate requirements, draft exclusion, public/CMS/participant view rendering, private resource access and cancelled registration capacity.

Flutter tests cover empty login validation, all participant module screen rendering, API validation and malformed-response handling, offline queue persistence across restart, one replay after reconnection, failed-action retention and account cache isolation.

Offline tests use mocked HTTP responses and secure storage. Native device secure storage, external resource opening, actual low-bandwidth use, release signing and hardware-specific behaviour still require device acceptance testing. The complete acceptance scenario is in the mobile README.

Web screenshot files in `docs/screenshots` show a locally seeded demo, not measured impact or live deployment data.

## Continued development validation

Laravel enterprise update and earnings filter tests: **17 tests, 95 assertions passed**. Coverage includes update ownership, duplicate-safe replay, date boundaries, enterprise filtering, and search without changing totals.

Flutter static analysis: **No issues found**. Flutter automated tests: **11 tests passed**. New tests cover earnings periods and API configuration. Native APK compilation and device acceptance testing remain pending.

## Learning progress and events validation

Laravel: **22 tests, 136 assertions passed**. Checks cover cancellation ownership and replay, capacity release, reuse of cancelled registrations, start-time and attendance restrictions, published-content progress, assessment-gated certificate readiness and empty-course handling.

Flutter: **16 tests passed**; static analysis reports **no issues found**. Added progress calculations and populated screen checks for certificate gating, cancellation confirmation, re-registration and closed events. Native APK compilation and physical-device testing remain pending.
